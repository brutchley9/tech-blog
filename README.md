# Tech Blog Application


For this week's assignment, I have developed an application that will allow the user to post blogs to a live webpage, but only after creating an account with a username and password. The application will utilize further knowledge of MySQL databases through Sequelize, along with a foundational understanding of Model-View-Controller web development.

Please make sure to look within the package.json file for any dependencies needed to run the application from the back end, as the developer would need to have the listed versions of bcrypt, connect-session-sequelize, dotenv, lexpress, express-handlebars, express-session, mysql2 and sequelize installed prior to use.
